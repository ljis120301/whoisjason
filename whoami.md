## Personally 
Who am I personally? I am a cronically online self proclaimed "femcel" but not in the traditional definition. I am just a nerdy incel who is also gay and maybe a little trans on the trans-fem side. I reject all "manhood" that has been placed upon me as I don't see that it fits who I am as a person. I have a loving boyfriend who I have been seeing for a while now. I live a simple life with a cat and my apartment. I cook often and love to expiriment with cooking new meals. In my free time I usually watch shows like South Park, Rick and Morty, and other more raunchy humor shows. I hate censorship love offensive humor. I passionatly hate corporate lingo or corporate way of thinking. Morally I allign myself strongly with the FOSS foundation. While I am gay I do not allow my identity to define me, I can take a joke, While also holding liberal viewpoints. My moral compass is that "If it does not hurt others, it is okay" in the sense that anybody should be allowed to do whatever they want to, as long as it is not hurting another person.
